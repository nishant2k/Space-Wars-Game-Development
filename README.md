# Space-Wars-Game-Development
The following repository contains a game development project in which C# is used for scripting in the Unity game engine. The game is a shooting game that scrolls on a 2D plane and fires lasers at enemy spacecraft that are approaching us and attempting to kill us.
We must collect as many points as possible, with the new game providing an opportunity to break our previous record. In this game, the spacecraft must avoid obstacles that are asteriods.
A health bar and a coin management system are also included in the game. After deducting the needed coins, the health increases by one bar when the coin collection reaches a limit.
Our spaceship will be destroyed when the health reaches zero. 

Try downloading the ready-to-play zip file from the above collection of files to play the game on your desktop. After you've extracted the zip file, you'll see a play CS451 Project application file. Double-click it to start the game on your computer. Have fun playing the game.
